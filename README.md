Workshop 1: Coding Fundamentals
Make a p5.js sketch using 2D primitive shapes, loops, and random numbers.
Write your own functions and make calls to these functions in your code.
Experiment with at least one new item from the from the p5.js documentationLinks to an external site..
Keep notes to clearly document your process and learning.

Mandalla effect with variable angles and contributing circles, made using the translate, rotate and randomise function.

1: Manual placement using circle function and x/y values
2: Automatic array via Rotate() (failed)
3: Troubleshooting rotate4. Utilise Translate () to redesignate origin point of x/y axis to use rotate ()
5. Tweaking and streamlining code
6. Various outcomes (still image)
7. Integrating random numbers to animate and affect placement)
8. Various outcomes.


Having watched the workshop, I realized I did my previous work the long way.
Whilst coding this animation, I discovered how case sensitive javascript is, due to spending 20 minutes not understanding why my variables broke my canvas, before discovering let x and Let x are distinct code.
